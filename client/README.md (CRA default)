Recipe AI App — Frontend (React)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) and serves as the frontend interface for the AI-powered Recipe Generator.
Users can search ingredients, generate AI-assisted recipes, view details, and manage authentication — all powered by the Flask backend.



🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page reloads automatically when you save changes.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the output for best performance.

`npm run eject`

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back.
Ejecting gives full control over Webpack, Babel, and the build configuration.
